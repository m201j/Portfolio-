                    <h3>Welcome to My Photography Journey</h3>
                    <p>My name is Mahsa Jalali,I’m indusrial designer student at OCAD University with a deep passion for photography. 
                    <p>Photography is not just a job for me; it’s my way of telling stories. Every shot I take is an attempt to freeze a fleeting moment in time and share it with the world. My goal is to capture authentic, emotional images that will last a lifetime.</p>
                    <p>In my photography journey, I've worked with brands, individuals, and creative professionals to bring out the beauty in every shot. My style blends natural lighting with creative composition, allowing me to express the unique character of every subject I photograph.</p>
